### How to run the jar files
Before running either server-softeng-gc25.jar or client-softeng-gc25.jar be sure to have disabled the firewall for both of them.

##### Server
To run the server run the command in the terminal:
```
$ java -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=serverIp -jar server-softeng-gc25.jar
```
where serverIp is the IP Address of the server.
When the server is running, choose the id (int value) that corresponds to the serverIp used running the jar file.
Be sure to not select local host.


##### Client
To run the client run the command in the terminal:
```
$ java -jar client-softeng-gc25.jar
```
when the client is running, set the ip address of the server interface.
Be sure to select the correct IP Address of the server where the game is running, otherwise the client will have to be restarted.
Then select the id (int value) that corresponds to the ip address of your chosen Network Interface
